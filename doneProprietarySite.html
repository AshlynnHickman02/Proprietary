    <h3>How does this affect online culture?</h3>
        <p>The introduction of proprietary software early in the technology business strictly cut off anybody trying to grow a company using open-source software. Linux was one of the first open-source softwares that allowed other programs to be created and then later sold from it. Overall, the introduction of proprietary software helped the technology industry grow substantially by improving/inspiring creativity with the ability to use open-source, then change to proprietary.</p>
